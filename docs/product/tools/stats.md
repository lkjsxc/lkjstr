# Stats

## Purpose

Stats shows current-session relay counters and persisted operational summaries.

## Contract

- Stats opens from New Tab as the `network-stats` tab kind.
- It reads relay snapshots, cache status, persisted relay summaries, persisted
  job health, and runtime counters.
- It never creates relay subscriptions or changes relay settings.
- Manual refresh is always available.
- Optional auto-refresh polls every two seconds while enabled.
- Relay totals include open relays, active subscriptions, events, OK accepts,
  OK rejects, and sent plus received bytes.
- Cache status includes event, profile, notification, and storage estimate
  counts.
